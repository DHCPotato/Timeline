                    HSPPR launched its very own Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program to help manage and care for community cats. This humane initiative focuses on reducing overpopulation while giving outdoor cats a healthier, safer life in the neighborhoods they call home.

                    Once a K9-5K and festival, Pawtoberfest has grown into one of Colorado Springs’ most beloved dog-friendly beer tasting events. With new locations over the years and thousands of attendees, it blends brews, community, and compassion—all while raising funds for animals in need. Its popularity even earned a spot on Animal Planet’s list of the Top 10 Dog Festivals nationwide.
